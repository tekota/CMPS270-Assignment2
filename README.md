# CMPS270-Assignment2
assignment 2 for cmps 270
i originally did practically everything until I updated my macOS and it deleted everything. Fortunally, I kept a version of my codes in my OneDrive
and had to redo everything. That is why you can see that my commits are so close to each other (timewise) since I already did all of the work.
Hope it doesn't cause any suspicions or anything of that sort.
happy coding :)
